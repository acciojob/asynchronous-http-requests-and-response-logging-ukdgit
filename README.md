# Asynchronous HTTP Requests and Response Logging

## Instructions:
Write a program in Vanilla JavaScript that reads a list of URLs from an array asynchronously and makes HTTP requests to each URL in the list. The program should log the responses from each request to the console. You should use the provided array of URLs:
```javascript
Array:
const urls = [
  'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1',
  'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/2',
  'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3'
];
```

## Acceptance Criteria:

- The program should make asynchronous HTTP GET requests to each URL in the array.
- The program should handle the response for each request and log it to the console.
- The responses should be logged in a human-readable format.
- The program should be implemented using Vanilla JavaScript, without any external libraries or frameworks.
- The program should work correctly and log the responses from all requests without errors.
